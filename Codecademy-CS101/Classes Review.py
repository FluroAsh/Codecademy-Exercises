'''
From here you could...
(Implement in the future)

    1. Write a Grade method .is_passing() that returns whether a Grade has a passing .score.
    2. Write a Student method get_average() that returns the studentâ€™s average score.
    3. Add an instance variable to Student that is a dictionary called .attendance, with dates as keys and booleans as values that indicate whether the student attended school that day.
    4. Write your own classes to do whatever logic you want!
