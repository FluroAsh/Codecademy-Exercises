"""Letâ€™s go over the terminal output of the past two instructions. You should see the following output in your terminal right now:

<class 'dict'> does not have the count attribute :(
<class 'str'> has the count attribute!
<class 'int'> does not have the count attribute :(
<class 'list'> has the count attribute!

This is because dictionaries and integers both do not have a count attribute, while strings and lists do. In this exercise, we have iterated through can_we_count_it and
used hasattr() to determine which elements have a count attribute. """
